Q. What's the difference between this and the gsm.f from the main GSM2008 website? The gsm.f is a very basic Fortran code, which reads and writes values to and from ASCII files, and uses a command line interface for input. If you want to run this code on an ancient computer with nothing by Fortran installed, then gsm.f is the way to go. In contrast, PyGSM is a Python code that leverages a lot of other Packages so that you can do more stuff more efficiently. For example: you can view a sky model in a healpy image; you can write a sky model to a Healpix FITS file; and believe it or not, the Python implementation is much faster. Have a look at the quickstart guide to get a feel for what PyGSM does.

Q. Are the outputs of gsm.f and pygsm identical? At the moment: no. The cubic spline interpolation implementation differs, so values will differ by as much as a few percent. The interpolation code used in gsm.f does not have an open-source license (it's from Numerical Recipes ), so we haven't implemented it (one could probably come up with an equivalent that didn't infringe). Nevertheless, the underlying PCA data are identical, and I've run tests to check that the two outputs are indeed comparable.
